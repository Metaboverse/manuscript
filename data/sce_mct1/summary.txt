Notes
========================
- Each is mct1 vs wt at time point after switch to raffinose
- Maybe other time points should be zeroed?
- Same motifs show up, but with different behavior
- Future directions: ability to track more quantitatively motifs that are changing
- Collapse instances where one metabolite makes a lot of different motifs? Maybe coming from inclusion of proteins?
- Penalize high-hub nodes during motif search? Reactions probably less sensitive to high hub concentrations?
- Outline selected motif stamp in first pane once clicked
- Add interactive time course line graphs to see patterns

===============================================================================
Observations
========================
- Conversion of Glycerol to Glycerol-3-phosphate
  - Goes from moderate down-regulation to severe

- palmitate and linoleic acid reactions often perturbed
  - Mostly situations where PALM is down and AMP or PPi are also measured
  - Even though lower PALM, more ACSL3,4 which can ligate coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to palmitate yielding palmitoyl-coenzyme

- citrate <=> isocitrate
  - Initially CIT is down and ISO is down just a little
  - Later CIT is really down and ISO is really up
  - CIT1 is down
  - May suggest ETC starts running in reverse in adaption to respiration-mandatory carbon source
    - How to test this? Prevent ETC from running in reverse in mct1 KO cells and see if it shows a phenotype compared to only mct1 KO

- CHAC1,2 cleaves GSH to OPRO and CysGly
  - GSH is very high and OPRO is tapered down

- Impaired cytochrome C
  - May lead to reduced electron transfer to complex III

- SDH down and FUMA up
  - Succinate catalyzes oxidation of succinate into fumarate
  - FUMA being created from Malate? (not measured)
