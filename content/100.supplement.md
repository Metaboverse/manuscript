### Reaction collapsing reveals multi-reaction motifs
Steady-state metabolomics processed data were obtained as measured and published in [@doi:10.7554/eLife.44235]. This study compared the metabolic environments of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor interstitial fluid and plasma. log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) values were calculated by comparing the tumor interstitial fluid to the plasma. Adjusted p-values were calculated using the student's T-test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Metaboverse motif searches identified a motif across the deamination reaction converting L-serine to pyruvate, as well as the alternative pathway, which involved an intermediate conversion of L-serine to D-serine before the conversion to pyruvate (Figure @fig:supp_fig_collapse). Conventional methods might have missed such a reaction without summarizing intermediate steps where the intermediate metabolite(s) are not measured.

  Metabolomics values are shown as node shading, where an increasingly blue shade indicates down-regulation, and an increasingly red shade indicates up-regulation. Measured log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) and statistical values for each entity are displayed below the node name. A gray node indicates a reaction. A bold gray node with a purple border indicates a motif was found at this reaction for the given data type time points. A dashed purple border indicates a motif was discovered across collapsed reactions. Non-reaction circles indicate metabolites and squares indicate proteins or protein complexes. Gray edges are core relationships between reaction inputs and outputs. Green edges indicate a catalyst. Dashed blue edges point from a metabolite component to the complex it is involved in. Dashed orange edges point from a protein component to the complex it is involved in. The background shading indicates different cellular compartments for each color.
