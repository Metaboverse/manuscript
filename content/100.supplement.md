### Reaction collapsing reveals multi-reaction putative regulatory patterns
Yeast time-course metabolomics processed data were obtained as measured and discussed in this study in Vignette 1. Metaboverse reaction pattern searches identified a pattern across the two step transformation of glutathione and methylglyoxal into lactate at 60 minutes after carbon source shift. As the intermediate metabolite was not measured in the dataset, but the inputs to the first reaction and the outputs to the second reaction were measured, Metaboverse collapsed the two reactions into one, thus enabling pattern recognition across two reactions (Figure @fig:supp_fig_collapse). Conventional methods might have missed such a reaction without summarizing intermediate steps where the intermediate metabolite(s) are not measured. This transformation is particularly important in this model as lactate is closely tied with TCA metabolism and may provide explanatory mechanisms for the changes in TCA metabolism observed in this model.

  (Left) Metabolomics values are shown as node shading, where an increasingly blue shade indicates down-regulation, and an increasingly red shade indicates up-regulation. Measured log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) and statistical values for each entity are displayed below the node name. A gray node indicates a reaction. A bold gray node with a purple border indicates a pattern was found at this reaction for the given data type time points. A dashed purple border indicates a pattern was discovered across collapsed reactions. Circles indicate metabolites, squares indicate protein complexes, diamonds indicate proteins, and triangles indicate genes. Gray edges are core relationships between reaction inputs and outputs. Green edges indicate a catalyst. Dashed blue edges point from a metabolite component to the complex it is involved in. Dashed orange edges point from a protein component to the complex it is involved in. The background shading indicates different cellular compartments for each color. The displayed values are for the 60 minute timepoint.
