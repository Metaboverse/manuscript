## Introduction

Metabolism is a complex network of reactions and interactions between genes, enzymes, complexes, and metabolites [@doi:10.3390/metabo9040076]. To understand these complex components, researchers normally adopt a reductionist approach to teasing apart the characteristics and mechanics of these processes and how they fit into the larger picture of biology and disease. While a vital component in the scientific process, by doing so, many interesting properties of metabolism can be missed. For example, in differential gene expression analysis, researchers rely on thresholds of magnitude and statistical significance to prioritize genes for follow-up study. However, doing so can inadvertently limit the scope of study of metabolism when in fact metabolism is a highly interconnected system where distal components and their modulation can have rippling effects across the network. The current approach is analogous to telling the story of Little Red Riding Hood, but only by reading the 20 most frequent words used in the study. Certainly doing so efficiently highlights key words like "wolf" and "little red riding hood," but also prevents a coherent story from being told and would make it difficult for someone who had never read the story of Little Red Riding Hood from comprehending the story.

Over the past decade, several computational tools have emerged and become popular for their focus on trying to solve these issues in data contextualization. We will highlight four, and while others exist, we focus on tools representative and most popular for their respective properties. First is MetaboAnalyst, which relies largely on set enrichment methods, or looking at the belongingness of sets of significantly changed analytes (i.e. metabolite, protein, or gene measurements), for extracting interesting information. While network visualization is available, its ability to extract regulatory information is limited, particularly in an automated fashion [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkp356; @doi:10.1093/nar/gky310]. Second is Cytoscape, which focuses on network representations of metabolism and other systems. While a variety of plug-ins are available for customizing analyses, again, comprehensive regulatory identification methods are unavailable [@doi:10.1101/gr.1239303]. MetExplore focuses on the curation of networks, and is particularly useful for collaborative annotation of emerging organisms. It additionally can layer experimental data on the network for visualization [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky301; @doi:10.1093/nar/gkq312]. Reactome, which Metaboverse uses for the curation of biological networks, also offers analytical tools for user data, but again relies on set enrichment or manual methods for identifying patterns. While all have their respective utility, there is still a need for tools that automate pattern and trend detection, especially when data is sparse, across metabolic networks in order to extract regulatory and other features from data [@doi:10.1093/nar/gki072; @pmid:31691815; @pmid:29145629].

In order to address these limitations in current conventions of metabolic data analysis, contextualization, and interpretation, we created the software application, <i>Metaboverse</i>, to aid users in filling in and expanding upon the details of their model's metabolic story. <i>Metaboverse</i> is an interactive tool for exploratory data analysis that searches user data in the context of the metabolic network to identify interesting patterns and trends within the data. <i>Metaboverse</i> will aid scientists in formulating new hypotheses from their data and aid them in designing follow-up experiments for a deeper understanding of their model. <i>Metaboverse</i> operates across the entire metabolic network to quickly and automatically detect patterns and trends from a pre-designed pattern library, or can accept interactive input from the user where they can define certain patterns or trends they would like to identify across the global metabolic network. Figure @fig:overview provides a graphical abstract to illustrate <i>Metaboverse's</i> role in the exploratory data analysis of biological data in the context of metabolism.

  **Metaboverse conceptual overview.**
  Illustration comparing traditional metabolic data analysis methods and the holistic approaches that Metaboverse offers. Traditionally, when a scientist performs an -omics experiment, they tend to focus on a couple of features that are differentially regulated. Metaboverse inversely contextualizes the data across the metabolic network and identifies interesting regulatory patterns in the data.

In order to provide a platform for the exploration of single or multi-omic metabolic data, we developed several computational features to aid in the aims discussed above. First, we developed a pattern search engine for the rapid and automated identification of patterns and trends in -omic data on the metabolic network. Conceptually, this search engine borrows principles of topological motif searching from graph theory [@doi:10.1126/science.1089167; @doi:10.1038/ng881] and builds upon the concept of "activity motifs" [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1499]. Another feature introduced in <i>Metaboverse</i> allows for the interactive exploration of specific reactions or reaction entities with on-the-fly pattern search analysis. Users can explore specific pathways of interest and look for other interesting patterns and trends in pathways of interest. Perturbations in the abundance or behavior of a particular metabolic network component can lead to downstream genotypic and phenotypic modulations in a biological system. We include an interactive perturbation connectivity module to allow users to explore the effects of perturbations on their system. Finally, we tackle the challenge of sparsity, particularly in metabolomics datasets, by introducing a reaction collapsing or bridging feature that allows for searching for motifs across multiple reactions, where intermediate steps of the reaction trajectory may not have measured values for their respective input or output components.

<i>Metaboverse</i> is designed to handle standard two-condition experiments, flux metabolomics (in progress), and time-course experiments (in progress). Time-course inputs can be single-omics, or static RNA-seq and/or proteomics with multiple metabolomic time-points. Users input fold change and statistical measures from their respective -omics, and <i>Metaboverse</i> reconciles the inputs for layering on the metabolic network. <i>Metaboverse</i> can handle data from a variety of model organisms, including humans, mouse, yeast, zebrafish, and more. The foundational curation of <i>Metaboverse</i> is built on the Reactome curations of metabolism, so any of the 90+ species available on that platform are also available within the <i>Metaboverse</i> environment. In order to validate these methodologies available in <i>Metaboverse</i> we analyzed two-condition, flux metabolomics, and time-course datasets and provide vignettes that highlight <i>Metaboverse's</i> reliability in extracting canonical features, as well as novel features and patterns, from well-defined biological models. We outline the technical specs for computational biologists in the methods section, and the biological utilities in the main text for wet bench biologists. We intend that <i>Metaboverse</i> will be foundational in our ability to more deeply and holistically explore metabolism and aid in our ability to provide more context within metabolic models.
