## Results

### Metaboverse is a dynamic, user-friendly tool for the exploration of high-throughput biological data in organism-specific pathways.

#### Overview.
We designed Metaboverse as a light-weight, self-contained app for the dynamic exploration of high-throughput biological data. The pathway curations are derived from Reactome, and as of writing, is capable of analyzing data for over ninety species. A user begins by providing a previously curated Metaboverse file, or the desired output location for a new curation and organism of interest. Next, the user provides the relevant transcriptomic, proteomic, and/or metabolomic datasets to layer onto the global reaction network of their organism of interest. These data categories can be extended to any dataset that uses the relevant mapping IDs; for example, one could provide ribosome profiling translation efficiency values mapped to the appropriate gene IDs for layering onto the network and downstream analysis. During this step, the user will also specify a few experimental parameters for consideration during downstream analysis and visualization. Following these user inputs, the organism's network, data processing, and motif analysis (discussed further below) is curated and a curation file is output for future analysis (see Figure @fig:package_overview).

We chose to format network visualizations in a reaction-centric format. This means that a sub-network unit comprises of a reaction node, linked with its reaction input and reaction output nodes, along with any nodes for modifiers. If modifier nodes are a protein complex, the component proteins of that complex are linked to the complex node. Any genes available in the database are linked to their related proteins. Each node and link type are color coded to help users quickly distinguish the details of a reaction sub-network structure. Reactions with matching input or output sides are then naturally linked, allowing a multi-reaction pathway to emerge from this graph structure. This formatting differs from other formatting styles users may be familiar with, such as KEGG pathway maps, for a couple of reasons. While this methodology differs from more classical methods, each pathway in the visualization module contains a button linking to a more classical formatting of the pathway from Reactome for reference.

#### Handling data sparsity within the biological global network.
Missing data points, particularly in metabolomics experiments, are frequent and can make analysis of pathways and identification of regulatory patterns in the network challenging.  While thousands of metabolites are known to participate in human metabolism, the current state of the technology for determining which mass spectra belong to which metabolite can be challenging and often results in a limited number of data points being quantified. These can lead to gaps in the metabolic network which can be challenging to explore and analyze. We therefore developed a reaction compression algorithm (detailed more in the Methods section) that collapses up to three reactions with missing data points if they can be bridged with known data on the distal ends of the reaction path. Methods similar to this have been used in metabolomic analysis before to identify amino acid-related metabolites [@doi:10.1038/s41586-019-1437-3], but we introduce the first computational implementation to our knowledge and adopt a slightly more conservative collapsing scheme. These reactions, or pseudo-reactions are visually distinct to show users where reactions were collapsed and understand what that pseudo-reaction summarizes.

#### Rapid identification of interesting regulatory patterns in the reaction network.
Following network curation, the user can visualize available reaction motifs identified across the global reaction network. In a computational science context, a motif is a re-occurring pattern in network structure, or the organization of network entities and their relationships to one another. However, with -omic data, we are more interested in identifying patterns in expression or abundance of genes, proteins, and metabolites. Previous work by Checkik, et. al. introduced the concept of "activity motifs", where instead of identifying motifs based on network structure, they were identified using the expression characteristics of nodes in transcription factor binding signaling networks [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1499]. We adapted this methodology to identify and interactively display interesting regulatory hotspots within the global reaction network. For example, a reaction's inputs may exhibit increased levels and its outputs low levels, indicating a regulatory event occurring at the reaction.

In Metaboverse, we define a motif as a regulatory pattern identified across a reaction or pseudo-reaction. Metaboverse contains a library of default motifs to search the network for, and users can define custom motifs they would like to identify across the global network (please refer to the documentation for more details on available motifs [@url:https://metaboverse.readthedocs.io/en/latest]). Metaboverse will search the global network from a pre-defined library of regulatory patterns (regulatory hotspots, or motifs) and return a graphical stamp view of conserved patterns. These motifs by default are ordered by the statistical values associated with the entity components of the motif, but can be ordered by the strength of the motif based on the magnitude of change. Statistical values associated with each measurement for a measured entity as provided by the user are used to weight these motifs and prioritize returned results. We use a three-tiered sorting strategy when sorting by the associated statistical values. The highest prioritized motifs are those where the relevant components on either side of the reaction (inputs vs. outputs) that determined the reaction motif are statistically significant. Of these motifs from the first tier, motifs are sorted by lowest to highest cumulative p-value or other relevant statistical value. In the second sorting tier, reactions where at least one side of the reaction had a statistically significant motif component are sorted by statistical strength. Finally, all other motifs are sorted by the cumulative statistical value for the motif components.

Reaction motifs are visually distinct during network visualization to quickly draw the user to these interesting patterns. For a given pattern, the user can then explore each pathway this particular motif is found in. Motif analysis of the global regulatory network will allow users to rapidly identify interesting features within the data, particularly patterns between canonical pathways or in other pathways that may seem tangential in their research, but are instead rather striking based on these contextualized analytical method. In the data vignettes below, we demonstrate this utility further. Users will also be able to design their own patterns through an interactive pattern drawing tool, and even design specific scenarios that are cognizant of feature type (in progress). For example, one might be interested in a pattern where a protein displays higher expression, but the resulting metabolite is decreased. This could then be coded interactively into the Metaboverse framework by the user.

#### Dynamic visualization of organism-specific reaction pathways.
Following curation of the global network as described above, the user can manually search individual canonical pathways or individual entities and their reaction neighborhoods. For a given selection, all relevant reactions that are annotated as a part of that pathway will be graphed, along with their core input (reactant) and output (product) components. In addition to these core elements, known catalysts and inhibitors are included, as well as the component proteins, genes, and metabolites that form functional complexes involved in a particular reaction. For complex nodes, simulated values are calculated by taking the average of all measured component entities in that complex. Assuming a statistical value between 0 and 1, simulated statistics are calculated by taking the maximum statistic value of all measured component entities in that complex. In cases where a gene value is known, but its protein value is unmeasured, the protein value can be inferred using aggregated gene component values. Relevant pathway and analytical metadata is also displayed. All reaction motif types are displayed using default thresholds if present in a selected pathway. Additional aids for visualization are also available, such as the ability to remove nodes from visualization that contain a high number of relationships to other network features such as that these nodes, which act as hubs in the network, do not lead to cluttered representations of the network. Often, these hub nodes are ubiquitous features such as water and proton which may be of limited interest to the user during data visualization [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz137]. Compartment domains are also graphed to include a relevant reactions and their components that occur in a given cellular compartment.

#### Visualization of downstream effects of network perturbations.
Users may be interested a particular metabolites or proteins and the downstream effects their perturbation has on related pathways. By double-clicking a node of interest, or by selecting the entity name from the drop-down menu, the user can explore all downstream effects across all pathways in the global network. The user can also define how many neighborhoods to display such that one can visualize two or more reaction steps downstream of the selected entity [@doi:10.1007/PL00009293; @doi:10.1016/0021-9991(86)90050-1]. This functionality moves the analysis away from traditional, pathway-centric approaches, and helps contextualize the far-reaching effects changes in metabolism or other biological systems can have across classical pathways.

#### Exploring perturbation connectivity within the global network
Abundance or behavioral changes of a metabolic network component can lead to downstream genotypic and phenotypic modulations in a biological system. One important measure of robustness of a network is "connectivity" [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz137; @doi:10.1038/nrg.2016.87]. In a biological context, an example of connectivity, or the loss of network connectivity, is easily grasped when considering a transport reaction from the cytosol into the mitochondria of a critical metabolite [@doi:10.1186/1756-0381-4-10; @doi:10.1093/gigascience/giz137; @doi:10.1007/s41109-019-0129-0; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087075]. When the transport hub is abolished and network connectivity is lost, the critical metabolite cannot participate in the required downstream reactions. For example, our laboratory previously established the consequences of the ablation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier on downstream citric acid cycle processes and the corresponding increase in lactate production [@doi:10.1126/science.1218099] and leads to serious cellular remodeling and dysfunction [@doi:10.1038/ncb3593; @doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2019.11.002].

The importance of connectivity could also be considered in a clinical context. For example, a druggable and critical metabolite may be perturbed in a particular disease context. However, if a metabolite participating in a neighboring, downstream reaction is also perturbed in a way not related to the perturbation of the first metabolite, the efficacy of the drug treatment could be severely impaired [@doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-3256; @doi:10.1126/science.1132939; @doi:10.1186/s12918-018-0674-7; @doi:10.1038/nrg.2016.87]. To aid in exploration of the connectivity of the biological network, we developed a connectivity module where users can display all reactions that have at least one involved component perturbed based on either an abundance or statistical level. By doing so, when the graph is constructed, proximal reactions that were perturbed will be "sewn" together to reconstruct a perturbation connectivity map. Perturbed, but un-connected reactions would be displayed as single reactions in the network.

### Data vignettes
In order to demonstrate the utility of Metaboverse to the community, we used Metaboverse to analyze public and new datasets. From the vignettes provided below, we show that Metaboverse not only is able to identify points of interest previously described or expected, but can rapidly identify for the user unexpected and systematic regulatory patterns in a reaction network context.

#### 1. Perturbation of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis across time.
Mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) acts as an important metabolic pathway long recognized to produce lipoic acid, a critical cofactor for several metabolic enzymes. Recent work has begun to uncover additional, important roles for this pathway. For example, we now know that mtFAS can perform metabolic nutrient sensing roles to coordinate lipoic acid synthesis with iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster biogenesis and assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, and more [@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2018.08.022; @doi:10.7554/eLife.17828]. Additionally, this pathway has received increased physiological focus with the discovery of patients with mutations in key mtFAS enzymes [@doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.09.021].

<i>MCT1</i>in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is an evolutionarily conserved acyltransferase responsible for the transfer of a malonyl group from malonyl-CoA to the mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP). By knocking out this gene, one can simulate the effects of a disruption in mtFAS. In order to probe the relationship between mtFAS-related protein concentration and the effects of its perturbation on downstream metabolic processes from a systematic perspective, we used a <i>mct1</i>&Delta; model in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> to measure steady state proteomics and transcriptomics at 12 hours after a shift to a non-fermentable carbon source, as well as steady state metabolomics at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 180 minutes after this shift in carbon source. By layering these data onto the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> metabolic network using Metaboverse, we observed interesting respiratory signatures as expected based on our previous work [@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2018.08.022; @doi:10.7554/eLife.17828]. For example, using Metaboverse, we noticed a strong pattern in the electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome C of complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC) (Figure @fig:mct1_vignette A). At the proteomics level, cytochrome C component proteins, CYC1 and CYC7 are both significantly reduced in concentration compared to wild-type cells (log<sub>2</sub>(fold change): -1.57 & -0.88; p-value: < 0.01 & < 0.01; respectively). This reduction in cytochrome C concentration is paired with a marked reduction in concentration of the protein components of cytochrome C reductase, which is a catalyst of this electron transfer reaction (average log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) of all measured protein components = -2.03, where 9/11 component proteins were measured (7/11 passed statistical significance thresholds of BH-corrected p-value <= 0.05). Range of significant log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) values: -0.34 to -3.21).

A second pattern of interest that we expect in this model is the characteristic reduction of TCA-related enzymes. Motif analysis within the TCA cycle displays regulatory hotspots between metabolites and metabolite-protein interactions throughout the steps of the TCA cycle (Figure @fig:mct1_vignette B). However, visualizing these motifs and data across the timecourse reveals interesting patterns. For the following metabolite values, we will provide those for the 15 minute timepoint as the statistical strength for the discussed metabolites is strongest at this time. For example, we notice while the catalytic enzymes in the TCA cycle are all reduced, several related metabolites are up-regulated across multiple time points in the dataset. First, citrate levels worsen across the metabolomics timecourse (at 15 min; log<sub>2</sub>FC: -0.-1.75, adjusted-p: 0.01), which is paired by reduced steady state levels of Ctp1 (log<sub>2</sub>FC: -0.64, adjusted-p: 0.03), a protein that catalyzes the transfer of citrate from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol [@doi:10.1074/jbc.270.8.4108]. Citrate is a key metabolite and the first step in the TCA cycle. We can hypothesize that due to central carbon metabolite reductions, Ctp1 may be down-regulated as a form of regulation to maintain citrate in the mitochondrial where it is most physiologically important from a metabolism point of view. Another point of interest is the up-regulation of Dic1 (log<sub>2</sub>FC: 2.15, adjusted-p: < 0.01), which catalyzes the transfer of malate (at 15min; log<sub>2</sub>FC: 2.61, adjusted-p: < 0.01) between the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol [@doi:10.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01197.x]. Interestingly, Dic1 is essential for growth in non-fermentable carbon source media. When yeast, especially those with deficits in TCA metabolism due to ablation of Mct1, are switched to a non-fermentable carbon, as was done in this experiment, they must adapt by up-regulating Dic1, as we see in this situation. Once malate is in the cytosol, it can be converted to pyruvate which can then feed the TCA cycle. This is further reasonable as these cells show reductions in pyruvate at time 0hr (log<sub>2</sub>FC: -1.09, adjusted-p: < 0.01), but gradually begin to enrich pyruvate levels closer to WT levels (at 30min; log<sub>2</sub>FC: -0.66, adjusted-p: 0.01). It is also possible that the increased fumarate levels (at 15min; log<sub>2</sub>FC: 1.00, adjusted-p: < 0.01) are related to the reduction in active fumarate hydratase (FH tetramer; log<sub>2</sub>FC: -1.39, adjusted-p: 0.03) as has been demonstrated previously and shown to associate with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer in humans [@doi:10.1038/nature19353]. This would therefore be an interesting point of further study to understand the adaptations these cells make to disruptions to the TCA cycle and their consequences.

By analyzing this multi-omics dataset using reaction motif analysis and other interactive visualization, interesting questions arise. We see several reaction motifs that are expected based on prior knowledge of this biological model, as well as other interesting behaviors worthy of further follow-up. This demonstrates the potential Metaboverse has to act as a valuable hypothesis-generation tool, as well as a convenient platform for visualization and analysis of a user's dataset in the context of the metabolic or other reaction networks.
