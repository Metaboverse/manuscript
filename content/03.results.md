## Results

### Metaboverse is a dynamic, user-friendly tool for the exploration of high-throughput biological data in organism-specific pathways.

#### Overview.
We designed <i>Metaboverse</i> as a light-weight, self-contained app for the dynamic exploration of high-throughput biological data. The pathway curations are derived from Reactome, and as of writing, is capable of analyzing data for ## species. A user begins by providing a previously curated Metaboverse file, or the desired output location for a new curation, and selecting their organism of interest. Next, the user provides the relevant gene, protein, and/or metabolite datasets they would like layered onto the global reaction network of their organism of interest. These data categories can be extended to any dataset that uses the relevant mapping IDs; for example, one could provide ribosome profiling translation efficiency values mapped to the appropriate gene IDs for layering onto the network and downstream analysis. During this step, the user will also specify a few experimental parameters for consideration during downstream analysis and visualization. Following these user inputs, the organism's network, data processing, and motif analysis (discussed further below) is curated and a curation file is output for future analysis.

#### Filling in the missing space.
Missing data points, particularly in metabolomics experiments, are frequent and can make analysis of pathways and identification of regulatory patterns in the network challenging. We therefore developed a reaction compression algorithm (detailed more in the Methods section) that collapses up to three reactions with missing data points if they can be bridged with known data on the distal ends of the reaction path. These reactions, or pseudo-reactions are visually distinct during visualization of the network and allow the user to quickly identify interesting patterns in the network, learn what that pseudo-reaction was summarizing, and generate additional hypotheses based on the available information and lack of information.

#### Rapid identification of interesting regulatory patterns in the reaction network.
Following network curation, the user can visualize available reaction motifs identified across the global reaction network. In <i>Metaboverse</i>, we define a motif as a regulatory pattern identified across a reaction or pseudo-reaction. <i>Metaboverse</i> contains a library of default motifs to search the network for, and users can define custom motifs they would like to identify across the global network. <i>Metaboverse</i> then displays these motifs within a "stamp view", where available motifs are ranked and displayed by magnitude. For a given pattern, the user can then explore each pathway this particular motif is found in. Motif analysis of the global regulatory network will allow users to rapidly identify interesting features in the data, particularly patterns between canonical pathways or in other pathways that may not be an initial focus in their research. In the data vignettes below, we demonstrate this utility further.

#### Dynamic visualization of organism-specific reaction pathways.
Following curation of the global network as described above, the user can manually search individual canonical pathways or individual entities and their reaction neighborhoods. For a given selection, all relevant reactions that are annotated as a part of that pathway will be graphed, along with their core input (reactant) and output (product) components. In addition to these core elements, known catalysts and inhibitors are included, as well as the component proteins, genes, and metabolites known to form a functional complex as part of a reaction. Labels can be toggled on or off in the display, and the user can switch between viewing the values or statistics associated with each data point with their relevant color mapping. In cases where a gene value is known, but its protein value is unmeasured, the protein value will be inferred using aggregated gene component values. The same is then done for functional complexes using their inferred or known component values. Relevant pathway and analytical metadata is also displayed. Other information, such as identified motifs found in the pathway can also be found and expanded for further exploration in a new window. Aids for visualization are also available, such as the ability to remove nodes from visualization that contain a high number of relationships to other network features such as that these nodes, which act as hubs in the network, do not lead to cluttered representations of the network. Often, these hub nodes are ubiquitous features such as water and proton which may be of limited interest to the user during data visualization. Compartment domains are also graphed to include a relevant reactions and their components that occur in a given cellular compartment.

#### Visualization of downstream effects of network perturbations.
Users may be interested a particular metabolite or protein and the downstream effects its perturbation has on related pathways. By double-clicking a node of interest, or by selecting the entity name from the drop-down menu, the user can explore all downstream effects across all pathways in the global network. The user can also define how many neighborhoods to display such that one can visualize two or more reaction steps downstream of the selected entity.

### Data vignettes
In order to demonstrate the added utility of <i>Metaboverse</i> to the community that is not currently available in other tools, we used <i>Metaboverse</i> to analyze a series of public and new datasets. From the vignettes provided below, we show that <i>Metaboverse</i> not only is able to identify points of interest previously described or expected, but can rapidly identify for the user unexpected and systematic regulatory patterns in a reaction network context.
