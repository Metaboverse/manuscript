## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Metabolism and other biological interactions and reactions are complex, each with variable inputs, outputs, and modifiers. The harmony between these factors consequently determines the health and stability of a cell or organism. Perturbations to these components often have rippling downstream effects. These effects can be difficult to trace across the global reaction network, particularly when the effects occur between canonical representations of pathways. Researchers have primarily utilized reductionist approaches to understanding these systems; however, these methods are limit the scope of the analysis. Even the power of systems-centric -omics approaches can be limited when only a  handful of high magnitude signals in the data are prioritized. To address these challenges, we developed Metaboverse, an interactive desktop app for the exploration and automated extraction of potential regulatory events, patterns, and trends from multi-omic data within the context of the metabolic network and other global reaction networks. This framework will be foundational in increasing our ability to holistically understand static and temporal metabolic events and shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity.

  **Metaboverse conceptual overview.**
  Illustration summarizing the usage of Metaboverse to model biological data on the global reaction network to rapidly identify regulatory hotspots. Traditionally, when a scientist performs an -omics experiment, they tend to focus on a couple of features that are differentially regulated. Metaboverse contextualizes the data across the metabolic network and identifies interesting regulatory patterns in the data.
