## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Metabolism and its component reactions are complex, each with variable inputs, outputs, and modifiers. The harmony between these factors consequently determines the health and stability of a cell or an organism. Perturbations to any reaction or set of reactions can have rippling downstream effects, which can be challenging to trace across the total reaction network, particularly when the effects occur between complex interconnected pathways. Researchers have primarily utilized reductionist approaches to understand metabolic reaction systems; however, these simplistic methods often limit the scope of the analysis. Even systems-centric omics approaches can be limited when only a handful of high magnitude signals in the data are prioritized for interpretation. To address these challenges, we developed Metaboverse, a user-friendly app for the rapid and thorough extraction of all regulatory patterns and trends within the user data overlaid on the metabolic and other reaction networks. We demonstrate Metaboverse's ability to rapidly extract reliable patterns from multi-omics datasets, as well as demonstrate its ability to highlight novel contextual patterns. This framework will be foundational in increasing our ability to holistically understand metabolic events and perturbations as well as gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity.
