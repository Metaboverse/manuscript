## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Metabolism and other biological interactions and reactions are complex, each with their specific inputs, outputs, and modifiers. The harmony between these factors consequently determines the health and stability of a cell or organism. Perturbations often have rippling downstream effects. These effects can be difficult to trace across the global reaction network, particularly when the effects cross canonical illustrations of pathways. Researchers have largely utilized reductionist approaches to understanding these systems; however, these methods are limited in their scope, and even systems-centric -omics approaches are often used to identify the differentially expressed or abundant factors and the downstream analysis of the model is then limited to these handful or "loud" signals in the data. To address these challenges, we developed Metaboverse, a multi-omic computational platform for the interactive exploration and automated extraction of potential regulatory events, patterns, and trends from user data within the context of the metabolic network. This framework will be foundational in increasing our ability to holistically understand static and temporal metabolic events and shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity, as well as ensure we obtain the maximum extraction of information from our data.
