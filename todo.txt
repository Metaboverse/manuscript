# To Do


### Software

#### For bioRxiv
[ ] Motifs improvement
		[ ] Statistical sorting
				[ ] Motifs 1-5
				[ ] Only return global motifs that pass a statistical thresholding
[ ]	Add preliminary Mct1 data
[ ] Author draft manuscript
[ ] Time course multi-condition
		[ ] UpSet plot of similar/disimilar motifs each sample vs each other
				sample
		[ ] Interactive line plot
[ ] Show unmapped entities in window
[ ] Show some basic data QC
[ ]	Improve error reporting -- make more informative
[ ] Packaging
		[ ] Windows/Linux/Mac
		[ ]	Package with python and dependencies, make stable across platforms

[ ] Human networks
	- Says collapsed when not
	- shading reaction nodes with expression values
	- Pathways in motif view not showing
	- were complexes being shaded? No protein data



#### For journal submission
[ ]	Add connected reactions options
		[ ]	Remove elements that didn't change to reduce clutter, or collapse
				to one super-node that when clicked can open up the other elements
[ ]	Cell activity summary from ordered and p-valued pathway activity ratio
		analysis
		[ ]	See Kotliar, eLife, 2019 for matrix factorization method that may be useful
[ ] Improve performance
		[ ] Anything that uses a for loop, use a dictionary for faster access and
				look-up after initial load
[ ] Flux integration
		[ ] PCA on flux
[ ] Interactive motif builder
[ ] Issues mapping gene values to proteins --> yeast is requiring names,
		can't use IDs
[ ] Check collapsing is working correctly. Some seem to leave some plotting of
		components out
		[ ] Test collapse with/without modifiers in collapsing accurate
		[ ] Show reactions that were collapsed


### Notes
- 400-500 for LC-MS
 	- Ask James for a LC dataset, whats the technical space and how to collapse
		in the network
	- Schedule James
	- MIDAS library is a good reference for LC
