# To Do


### Software

#### For bioRxiv
[ ] Motifs improvement
		[ ] Statistical sorting
				[ ] Motifs 1-5
				[ ] Only return global motifs that pass a statistical thresholding
[ ]	Add preliminary Mct1 data
[ ] Author draft manuscript
[ ] Time course multi-condition
		[ ] UpSet plot of similar/dissimilar motifs each sample vs each other
				sample
		[ ] Interactive line plot
[ ] Show unmapped entities in window
[ ] Show some basic data QC
[ ]	Improve error reporting -- make more informative
[ ] Packaging
		[ ] Windows/Linux/Mac
		[ ]	Package with python and dependencies, make stable across platforms

[ ] Human networks
	- Says collapsed when not, or says a motif is in the pathway when not
	- shading reaction nodes with expression values
	- Pathways in motif view not showing
	- were complexes being shaded? No protein data
[ ] Can't select new pathway after opening window from motif page
[ ] Lots of very similar collapsed reactions

[ ] When plotting more than 500 nodes, now warning
[ ] Toggle complexes
[ ] Toggle modifiers
[ ] Option to limit connectivity to just one superpathway
[ ] kNN not working in connectivity



#### For journal submission
[ ]	Add connected reactions options
		[ ]	Remove elements that didn't change to reduce clutter, or collapse
				to one super-node that when clicked can open up the other elements
[ ]	Cell activity summary from ordered and p-valued pathway activity ratio
		analysis
		[ ]	See Kotliar, eLife, 2019 for matrix factorization method that may be useful
[ ] Improve performance
		[ ] Anything that uses a for loop, use a dictionary for faster access and
				look-up after initial load
[ ] Flux integration
		[ ] PCA on flux
[ ] Interactive motif builder
[ ] Issues mapping gene values to proteins --> yeast is requiring names,
		can't use IDs
[ ] Check collapsing is working correctly. Some seem to leave some plotting of
		components out
		[ ] Test collapse with/without modifiers in collapsing accurate
		[ ] Show reactions that were collapsed


### Notes
- 400-500 for LC-MS
 	- Ask James for a LC dataset, whats the technical space and how to collapse
		in the network
	- Schedule James
	- MIDAS library is a good reference for LC





Lung

Connectivity reactions sewn together by glucose, glycerol, nucleic acids, and related

GLYCTK expressed in liver, lung, and skin
AMP, 5,6-dihydrouracil up
Glucose depletion far reaching effects across several reactions -- is this direction correct?

Glycerol shown up and
Glycerol, which is the backbone of all lipids, is also increased in sera from advanced-stage lung cancer patients, which is indicative of either lipid breakdown or cell membrane rearrangement (Deja et al., 2014).  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6033515/

D-glyceric acid (DGA)
On the other hand, decreased levels of glyceric acid and L-glutamic acid were seen in advanced stage tumors, suggesting that these metabolites may be transferred from the blood into the lung tissue and then metabolized rapidly within the tissue (Hori et al., 2011).  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6033515/


All other TCA are up except citrate
Supports idea that pyruvate -> lactate and TCA is fed through glutamine upregulation


jActiveModules uses p-values

Delta based on timepoint of interest
M0/Mtotal or other
Use time point as reference
Make sure iteration of MPC flux is correct. Others were not, but the one I have looks good
