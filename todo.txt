# To Do

### Software
[ ]	Add preliminary Mct1 data
		[ ] Re-run proteomics and metabolomics stats
[ ] Time-course integration
		[ ] Slider bar for viz, connectivity, and motifs
		[ ] Interactive line plotting
[ ] Fix hub thresholding
[ ] Improve human metabolite name mapping
		[ ] There are still instances where data mapping or reaction completion is
				still inconsistent
[ ] Check collapsing is working correctly. Some seem to leave some plotting of
		components out
		[ ] Show reactions that were collapsed
		[ ] For repeated forward and reverse reactions, only show once
[ ] Motifs improvement
		[ ] Highlight if modifier changed where inputs and outputs are same (minus
				compartment) --> regulation of transport reaction
		[ ] Highlight any modifier regulated reactions?
		[ ] Motif where catalyst is down and output metabolite is down (CIT1 and
				isocitrate) -- other instances that are expected or unexpected
		[ ] Statistical sorting
		[ ]	Add options to not allow sustained motif if same on both sides
		[ ] Option to not consider high-hub nodes
		[ ] Order PathMax by percentage of pathway coverage
[ ] Show unmapped entities in window
[ ] Show some basic data QC
[ ]	Improve error reporting -- make more informative
[ ]	Add connected reactions options
		[ ]	Still needs to show motifs
		[ ]	Remove elements that didn't change to reduce clutter, or collapse
				to one super-node that when clicked can open up the other elements
[ ]	Cell activity summary from ordered and p-valued pathway activity ratio
		analysis
		[ ]	See Kotliar, eLife, 2019 for matrix factorization method that may be useful
[ ] Improve performance
		[ ] Anything that uses a for loop, use a dictionary for faster access and
				look-up after initial load
[ ] Flux integration
		[ ] PCA on flux
[ ] Interactive motif builder
[ ] Packaging
		[ ] Windows/Linux/Mac
		[ ]	Package with python and dependencies, make stable across platforms
			
### Manuscript
[ ]	Outline caveats in discussion and future directions while in beta test,
		tell working on more 	validation and improvement in weak areas
		- Make it clear that this isn't the final version (in progress)
		- Add authors note on bioRxiv comments section for each manuscript version
